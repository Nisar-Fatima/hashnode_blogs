**Hello everyone üëã**

I started revising my database concepts through **CodeHelp - by Babba**[**r**](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeHelp) **DBMS series**,and one of his videos covered 50 SQL interview practice questions. I didn‚Äôt create these questions myself ‚Äî they were provided in the video ‚Äî but I decided to **solve each one independently**, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and logically sound SQL queries.

This blog is my way of sharing that learning journey ‚Äî to help others who are also revising or preparing for SQL-based interviews.

## üé• **Reference Video**

Before jumping into these 50 SQL practice questions, I highly recommend watching **CodeHelp - by Babba**[**r**](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeHelp) **complete SQL video** on YouTube.

It‚Äôs an excellent starting point to **grasp all SQL fundamentals, concepts, and query structures** in a clear and practical way. Once you‚Äôve learned the concepts from the video, you can use this question set to **strengthen your understanding through hands-on practice**.

## üí° My Approach

Instead of copying answers, I challenged myself to:

* Write every query **from scratch**,
    
* Apply **different logic** wherever possible, and
    
* Understand **why** each query works, not just **how**.
    

This approach helped me gain deeper clarity about query design, functions, and optimization.

If you‚Äôre also learning SQL, I‚Äôd recommend watching the video first, then trying to solve the questions on your own before checking my answers.

üí° **Note:**  
I‚Äôve intentionally kept **questions and solutions separate** ‚Äî so you can first try to solve each query on your own. This approach helps strengthen your problem-solving skills and ensures you truly understand the logic behind every SQL concept.  
If you ever get stuck, you can always check the **detailed solutions on GitHub** for reference.
