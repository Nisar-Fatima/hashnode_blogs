## 📌 Introduction

This week, I started my journey into **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**. Instead of just keeping notes to myself, I’ve decided to share my **weekly learnings** here so that others who are also studying DBMS can benefit from the same resources.

Along with learning theory, I also tried implementing concepts through **ER diagrams**, which made the ideas much clearer.

## **📖 Core Approach (Step by Step Guide + Examples)**

1. **Identify Entity Sets** (e.g., Student, Customer, Post, Employee)
    
2. **Identify Attributes** of each entity (simple, composite, multivalued, derived).
    
3. **Assign Data Types & Keys** (PK, FK, unique, nullable).
    
4. **Identify Relationships** between entities:
    
    * Strong or Weak
        
    * Degree (Unary, Binary, Ternary)
        
    * Mapping Cardinality (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
        
    * Participation Constraints (Total / Partial).
        

### ✅ **Example 1: Banking System ER Model**

A banking system is one of the most popular examples used in DBMS.

* **Special Features:**
    
    * Composite attribute: *Address* (Street, City, State).
        
    * Multivalued: Customer may have multiple phone numbers.
        
    * Weak entities: *Transaction* (depends on Account), *Card* (depends on Account).
        
    * Derived: Age (from DOB), Account\_Age (from Date\_Opened).

# 📌 ER Diagram → Relational Model Conversion Rules:

👉 Converting **ER design** into **Relational design** is a crucial step in building a database. Let’s break down how each ER concept maps into a relational schema.

## 1\. Strong Entity

* Each **strong entity** becomes an **individual table**.
    
* Attributes → Columns in the table.
    
* Primary Key (PK) → Entity’s PK is directly the relation’s PK.
    
* Foreign Keys (FKs) → Added to establish relationships with other entities.
    

✅ Example:  
`Customer(Customer_ID [PK], Name, Email, Phone)`

---

## 2\. Weak Entity

* A **weak entity** cannot exist without its strong entity.
    
* Becomes a separate table.
    
* PK of strong entity is added as FK.
    
* Composite PK = {Strong Entity PK (FK) + Discriminator Key}.
    

✅ Example:  
`Order_Item(Order_ID [FK], Item_No, Quantity, PRIMARY KEY(Order_ID, Item_No))`

---

## 3\. Single-Valued Attributes

* Directly represented as **columns** in the table.
    
* No extra table is needed.
    

✅ Example: `Salary`, `Date_Of_Joining`

---

## 4\. Composite Attributes

* Break into **atomic attributes** in the main table.
    
* Do not keep the composite attribute as a column.
    

✅ Example:  
Instead of `Address`, store → `Street, City, State, Zip`.

---

## 5\. Multivalued Attributes

* Stored in a **separate table**.
    
* Table includes entity’s PK as FK + multivalued attribute.
    
* PK of new table = {Entity\_PK + Multivalued Attribute}.
    

✅ Example:

* `Employee(Emp_ID [PK], Name)`
    
* `Employee_Phone(Emp_ID [FK], Phone_No, PRIMARY KEY(Emp_ID, Phone_No))`
    

---

## 6\. Derived Attributes

* Not stored in relations.
    
* Calculated when needed.
    

✅ Example: `Age` derived from `DOB`.

---

## 7\. Generalization / Specialization

### Method 1 (Default)

* Create a **table for the supertype**.
    
* Create separate **tables for each subtype**, including subtype attributes + supertype PK (as FK).
    

✅ Example (Bank Account):

* `Account(Account_No [PK], Balance)`
    
* `Savings_Account(Account_No [FK, PK], Interest_Rate)`
    
* `Current_Account(Account_No [FK, PK], Overdraft_Limit)`
    

### Method 2 (Disjoint + Complete Generalization)

* Skip the supertype table.
    
* Create tables for subtypes including both supertype and subtype attributes.
    

✅ Example:

* `Savings_Account(Account_No [PK], Balance, Interest_Rate)`
    
* `Current_Account(Account_No [PK], Balance, Overdraft_Limit)`
    

⚠️ **Drawback:** If overlapping/generalization is not complete → redundancy & missing data risk.

---

## 8\. Aggregation

* Represented as a **relationship table**.
    
* Includes PKs of all participating entities + descriptive attributes.
    

✅ Example:  
Customer places Order → generates Payment.  
`Order_Payment(Customer_ID [FK], Order_ID [FK], Payment_ID [FK], Payment_Mode, Amount)`

## 📚 Resources I Used

Along with standard references, I especially followed **DBMS YouTube Series(** *CodeHelp-by babbar DBMS Series)*, which explained the concepts in a very simple and student-friendly way.his playlist explains DBMS concepts in a **simple and student-friendly way**.

👉 What’s even better: **each video has detailed notes provided in the description/under the video**, so you don’t need to write everything yourself. You can directly learn, revise, and practice using them

Other helpful resources:

* 📘 *Database System Concepts* by Silberschatz, Korth, Sudarshan
    
* 🌐 GeeksforGeeks DBMS Notes
    
* 🌐 TutorialsPoint DBMS Tutorial

## 📝 Conclusion

That’s a wrap for my **Week 1 of DBMS learning**.  
The biggest takeaway for me was that **databases are not just about storage, but about meaningful organization of data into useful information**.

From next week, I’ll continue hands-on practice on **SQL Workbench**, where I’ll be writing and testing queries. I’ll also put together a list of **important SQL queries** that can help beginners get started easily.

✨ Stay tuned for my updates — it’s going to be fun and practical! 🚀
